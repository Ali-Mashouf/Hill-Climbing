# *Hill-Climbing*
The Hill Climbing algorithm is a local search method used to find the maximum or minimum of a function. This algorithm starts from a random or specified initial point and then iteratively moves toward neighboring points that improve the function value. This process continues until a local maximum is reached or a specified number of iterations are completed.
