# *Hill-Climbing*
*The Hill Climbing algorithm is a local search method used to find the maximum or minimum of a function. This algorithm starts from a random or specified initial point and then iteratively moves toward neighboring points that improve the function value. This process continues until a local maximum is reached or a specified number of iterations are completed.*

## How the algorithm works:

1. *Start from a random point*
2. Calculate the objective function value
3. Select the best neighbor
4. Move to the best neighbor
5. Repeat this process until no better neighbor exists than the current point

This algorithm is suitable for problems with small search spaces.

**Disadvantages:** It should be noted that it can easily converge to a local optimum and get stuck there, failing to find the global optimum.
