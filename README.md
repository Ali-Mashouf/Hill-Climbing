# *Hill-Climbing*
*The Hill Climbing algorithm is a local search method used to find the maximum or minimum of a function. This algorithm starts from a random or specified initial point and then iteratively moves toward neighboring points that improve the function value. This process continues until a local maximum is reached or a specified number of iterations are completed.*

## How the algorithm works:

1. *Start from a random point*
2. *Calculate the objective function value*
3. *Select the best neighbor*
4. *Move to the best neighbor*
5. *Repeat this process until no better neighbor exists than the current point*

*This algorithm is suitable for problems with small search spaces.*

*It should be noted that it can easily converge to a local optimum and get stuck there, failing to find the global optimum.*
