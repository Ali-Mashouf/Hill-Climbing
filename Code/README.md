***This simple implementation demonstrates the Hill Climbing optimization algorithm.***
**The algorithm's goal is to find the values of x and y that ***maximize*** the objective function func(x, y)**

# Functions Used
***The code uses two main types of functions:***

1. return -x**2 - y**2 + 4
***This function is an inverted paraboloid whose global maximum is at the point (0, 0) with a value of 4***
***This function is excellent for demonstrating the algorithm because:***
   ***It has a clear and distinct global maximum.***
   ***It is simple and fast to compute***
   ***It allows for easy observation and verification of the algorithm's convergence towards the         point (0, 0)***
